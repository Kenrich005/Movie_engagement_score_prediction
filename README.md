## Problem Statement
 ABC is an online content sharing platform that enables users to create, upload and share the content in the form of videos. It includes videos from different genres like entertainment, education, sports, technology and so on. The maximum duration of video is 10 minutes. Users can like, comment and share the videos on the platform. Based on the user’s interaction with the videos, engagement score is assigned to the video with respect to each user. Engagement score defines how engaging the content of the video is. Understanding the engagement score of the video improves the user’s interaction with the platform. It defines the type of content that is appealing to the user and engages the larger audience.
 
## Objective
 The main objective of the problem is to develop the machine learning approach to predict the engagement score of the video on the user level.
